-C++ is a compiled language.
-Compilation or compiling is when you convert the human-readable code into machine-readable code.
-Linking is when you combine compiled code into an executable.

-C++ majorly promoted object-oriented programming.
-Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that involves objects, which contain data and code. 
Data being attributes or properties and code being procedures or methods.

-Lists are known as vectors in C++.

-C++ uses generic programming. This is where algorithms are designed where types are to be specified later.
For instance, a method with a generic parameter and a generic return.

Almost everything that is in C is in C++. C++ expands upon C and is often considered a superset of C;
